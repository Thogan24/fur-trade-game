This demo integrates the two main parts of our project: Unity (our 'front end') and Photon Unity Networking 2 (PUN2) (our 'back end', how we manage multiplayer and communicating across machines)
The scene & squares are created using Unity, while the multiplayer scripts are part of the Photon Unity Networking system.
