# fur-trade-game
An online multiplayer digital version of the card game "Fur Trade Game", created for the Philipse Manor Hall. This is an educational trading game made for the purpose of teaching students history in real life classrooms.
This project utilizes multiple pieces of software: The Unity Game Engine editor, Visual Studio Code (Using C#), and the Unity Package Photon Unity Networking 2 (PUN2) (how we communicate across machines). 
If you would like a version of the game, a version must be requested from us (email thogan1924@gmail.com) as this is an exe file made for specific users.
